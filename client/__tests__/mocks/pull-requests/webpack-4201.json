Before this change, every time a new environment variable or webpack configuration was added, several errors would need to be added. With this change it should be much easier and less error-prone to add more tests.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Other information**\r\nMy first PR ðŸŽ‰  I'm happy to contribute with this awesome tool ðŸ˜ƒ",
